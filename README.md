# Vendo

This is a Firebase 3.0,  Angular Js v1.5.4 and Materialize restaurant management web application.

This is an app for restaurant owners and vendors. Restaurant owners can keep their vendors organized, find new vendors to improve quality. Vendors can keep their restaurants organized, keep track of products offered, cultivate new business. Each user can place and track outstanding orders and keep track of invoicing.

## Contributing Bugfixes or Features

For submitting something back, be it a patch, some documentation, or new feature requires some level of
community interactions.

Committing code is easy:

- Fork the this repository
- Create a local development branch for the bugfix; I recommend naming the branch such that you'll
  recognize its purpose.
- Commit a change, and push your local branch to your github fork
- Send me pull request for your changes to be included

I apologize in advance for the slow action on pull requests and issues.
